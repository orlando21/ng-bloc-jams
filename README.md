## Bloc Jams (Angular version)

This is a single page web application implemented in HTML5, CSS3, and AngularJS. The app is intended to be a [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/us/) clone, and was built as a project in Bloc's [Frontend Web Development](https://www.bloc.io/frontend-development-bootcamp) coding bootcamp. 

Bloc Jams was originally built as a [jQuery application](https://github.com/orlando21/bloc-jams) and has been ported to Angular in this project.

As with the original app, it allows you to choose among different albums and songs with play, pause, seek, and skip functionality.

For more information and demo see my [portfolio](http://developer.textlogic.ch/portfolio/1-blocjams.html).

## Starting the app
Bloc Jams runs with a starter application using the `grunt` build tool and `npm`. The easiest way to run the app is to download and install these dependencies. More information can be found in the [starter application](https://github.com/Bloc/bloc-frontend-project-starter) repository.

A freeware music library loads with the application, but any library of mp3 files can be used.
