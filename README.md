## BlocJams

This is my student repository for implementing [Bloc's](https://bloc.io/) "BlocJams" application in AngularJS. The purpose of developing this app was to learn Angular features such as routing, states, factories, etc., by converting the existing $jQuery app into Angular.

This was done as part of Bloc's [Frontend Web Development Course](https://www.bloc.io/frontend-development-bootcamp).
